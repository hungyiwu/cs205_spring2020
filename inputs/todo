1. a config file. Inputs:
  - materials
  - N layer
  - alignment
  - hetero / homo? 
2. script to: 
  - reads the config file
  - load poscar
  - creates vasp input files
  - run vasp z relaxation

Note: if hetero, need to assume the lattice constants are the same
Also need to go through the materials systematically
